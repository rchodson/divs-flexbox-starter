            <main>
                <p>I am a <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com/">Skillcrush</a> student learning the ins and outs of responsive design as I try to find the best place for me in tech. When I'm not studying and practicing new skills, you'll find me caring for my four daughters, neurotic dog, and backyard birds, ignoring the laundry until it's almost too late, and sewing masks (<a href="https://dhuratadavies.com/blogs/things-i-make-and-do/free-face-mask-pattern-and-tutorial">this one's</a> my favorite pattern) to stave off Covid-19.</p>
            </main>

            <div class="div-1">
                <p>I love to travel, particularly by road or by rail; airplanes can get you farther faster, but you don't get to see as much! I've been all over the USA, England, western Europe, Brazil, and most recently Iceland. The world is so amazing and varied that I don't think I could pick just one favorite place!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>I grew up in Utah, but left at 17 to attend <a href="https://peace.edu">Peace</a>, a small women's college in North Carolina. I loved the name, the adventure of being far from home, and of course the sisterhood. The college ran into financial trouble a few years ago and decided going co-ed would solve things, but I'll always be a Peace Girl at heart.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>Fun fact: I love nature in the abstract, but fear of spiders and ticks prevents me from spending much time in it. I live in a region now where ticks aren't prevalent (you'd almost have to lick a deer to get Lyme Disease out here), but you'll still never catch me camping!</p>
